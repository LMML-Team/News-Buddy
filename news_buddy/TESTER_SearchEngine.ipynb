      "['', 'MS-13 members: Trump makes the gang stronger\\n\\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what\\'s happening in the world as it unfolds.\\n\\nLong Island, New York (CNN)The first time members of the MS-13 street gang attacked Margarita\\'s teenage son in suburban New York, they beat him with a baseball bat.\\n\\nThe young man had immigrated from El Salvador three months earlier to join his mother in Nassau County, Long Island. The gang had harassed him in El Salvador because he refused to join them. Now, in his new home, they were upping the stakes.\\n\\nThe second time, they attacked the 19-year-old as he was on his way to work. They slashed him in the stomach with a machete, the gang\\'s weapon of choice. He survived and has been in hiding for the last few weeks, but his mother is terrified.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s worse (in the US) because over there they hadn\\'t tried to kill him. But here they have,\" said the woman, who is undocumented and asked to be called only \"Margarita\" for her safety. She witnessed the first attack on her son, on the street outside their home, and says she\\'s too afraid to go to the police for fear of deportation.\\n\\nThe violent gang known as Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, originated decades ago among Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles and has since built a criminal network that extends across the US, with thriving pockets in the Washington, D.C. suburbs and here on Long Island, just an hour or so east of New York City. It\\'s estimated to have 10,000 members nationwide.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nPresident Trump has vowed to wipe them out and will visit Long Island Friday to discuss his plans. But the FBI says the gang is growing.\\n\\nInvestigators comb woods where the mutilated bodies of four young men were discovered in late April in Central Islip. Authorities believe MS-13 was behind the killings.\\n\\nAnd several people familiar with MS-13, including two gang members themselves, told CNN they think Trump\\'s crackdown on immigrants is actually making MS-13 stronger because witnesses are more reluctant to come forward for fear of being deported.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not like before, where ... they (the gang) were more hidden,\" said Margarita, adding that a decade after fleeing violence in El Salvador she has never felt more afraid. \"People can get deported, so they don\\'t call the police. So they (MS-13) feel more free.\"\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s emboldening them, because this gives them the opportunity to tell immigrants, \\'What are you gonna do? Are you going to report us? They\\'re deporting other innocent people ... (so) they\\'re going to associate you with us by you coming forward,\\'\" said Walter Barrientos, Long Island coordinator with Make the Road, an immigrant advocacy group.\\n\\n\"\\'So what are you going to do? Who\\'s going to protect you?\\' And that\\'s what really strikes many of us.\"\\n\\nBut a senior Trump administration official disputed that thinking.\\n\\n\"The reality is that we are removing MS-13 and other criminal gang members in very large numbers, and they are hurting,\" the official said.\\n\\n\"As far as reporting crime is concerned, the biggest impediment as I said earlier, is sanctuary cities, where ... illegal immigrant gang members are released from a prison or jail and then we have to go searching for them at great costs ... and at great personal risk to the officers.\\n\\n\"If you want to be looking at strategies that need to change and change right away, sanctuary cities would be at the top of that list.\"\\n\\n\\'We\\'re targeting you\\'\\n\\nWhile MS-13 has had a presence in the U.S. for decades, the level of violence and activity has risen considerably in the last two years, according to the FBI. And in recent months here, authorities say the gang has been on a killing spree.\\n\\nIn the last two years, the FBI says MS-13 has committed more than 20 slayings on Long Island, drawing national attention to the gang\\'s growing presence.\\n\\nLast September, two teenage girls from Brentwood were beaten to death in a case that put Nassau and Suffolk counties on the map as an epicenter of MS-13 activity.\\n\\nCNN Map\\n\\nIn April, the bodies of four young men, ages 16 to 20, were discovered in a park in Central Islip. They were beaten with wooden clubsand their bodies were butchered with machetes. Video of the mutilated bodies was sent to a girlfriend of one of the victims.\\n\\nSoon after Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited Central Islip and vowed publicly to combat MS-13. \"We are targeting you, we are coming after you,\" he said.\\n\\n\"MS-13 is our number-one priority on Long Island because much of what they do and how they behave boils down to violence for violence sake,\" said William F. Sweeney, Jr., head of the FBI\\'s New York field office, last week.\\n\\n\"The drugs they\\'re accused of selling (are) almost an excuse to retaliate and attack rivals, or others who cross them,\" Sweeney added. \"The idea that human life means nothing to these gang members should shock the conscience, and we cannot allow this type of thinking to take hold in our youth.\"\\n\\nThe gang mostly targets Central American immigrants, many who came to the US seeking refuge from gang violence back home in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras only to find themselves in danger again.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing that they\\'re targeting some of the most recently arrived youths who are coming into families who are in transition with their immigration status. Young people who don\\'t know a lot of people in the community, and who are easily targeted and scared,\" said Barrientos of Make the Road.\\n\\nEvelyn Rodriguez, mother of Kayla Cuevas, 16, who was brutally slain last year -- allegedly by members of MS-13 -- weeps outside a courthouse in Central Islip in March.\\n\\n\"They go to a school district not speaking the language and they\\'re in a new country so they are very vulnerable and these gangs preach protection,\" Morino said. \"And that\\'s a powerful recruitment tool.\"\\n\\n\\'I felt safe with them\\'\\n\\nDavid and Alex are just 16 and 17, but they have already been MS-13 gang members for three years.\\n\\nThe two, who don\\'t want their real names used out of fear for their safety, live in Hempstead, New York, where they recently agreed to meet late at night for an interview.\\n\\nDavid, who was born in the US to parents from El Salvador and Mexico, said he had no choice but to join MS-13 when he was 13. By age 9, he\\'d already seen someone get shot.\\n\\n\"I started growing up in that type of neighborhood. I didn\\'t really get love from my family. Where I grew up, they (MS-13) were there, almost all of them,\" he said. \"They seemed like really nice people. They were there for me through tough times.\"\\n\\n\"I had friends that were in gangs so I started talking with them and they started telling me how it would be if I joined, how they would have my back and everything. I felt safe with them,\" agreed Alex, who was born in Honduras and joined the gang at 14. \"If you\\'re not MS-13, you\\'re the target. You know, if you can\\'t beat them, join them. That\\'s what they want.\"\\n\\nA memorial candle lies in the grass near where the bodies of four young men were discovered on April 28 in Central Islip. They were beaten with wooden clubs and slashed with machetes.\\n\\nDuring their initiation into the gang, the teens each were beaten by three gang members for 13 seconds.\\n\\n\"It\\'s kind of a lesson when you join the gang to see if you\\'re man enough to take the beating,\" David said. \"You want to show them you\\'re not afraid of anything. They\\'re trying to see if you\\'re really man enough to join, man enough to take the beating.\"\\n\\nThe two teens don\\'t have scars or gang tattoos yet.\\n\\n\"You have to earn them,\" David said. \"They\\'re called battle scars, for the work you put in for the gang, and the beatings, stabbings, and shootings you\\'re taking for them ... those are like trophies when it comes to gangs.\"\\n\\nBoth say they see the futility of gang life and would like to leave the lifestyle behind. But it\\'s not easy.\\n\\n\"At one point I felt like, damn, why am I in this? Is that what I\\'m going for? Taking somebody\\'s loved one and hurting them? What if they took somebody from me?\" Alex said. \"You\\'re not a real man if you\\'re risking your life and risking your family to impress the streets. That\\'s what I want everybody to know,\" he added. \"Impressing the streets isn\\'t going to get you nowhere, honestly.\"\\n\\nAs for young people who might be thinking about joining MS-13, Alex has a message: Don\\'t.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to try to leave, you\\'re not going to be able to,\" he said. \"Don\\'t join ... because I know you\\'re going to regret it.\\n\\nThe Trump effect\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear what Trump will say when he speaks in Suffolk County on Friday. But the President has already been talking about the gang for months, reiterating his promise to arrest and deport them.\\n\\n\"Vicious and disgusting and horrible MS-13 gang members ... we\\'re getting them out,\" he said in June. \"They\\'ve gotten rid of 6,000 so far. We\\'re about 50 percent there. And we\\'re actually liberating towns, like on Long Island, where I grew up.\"\\n\\nAs of late June, ICE data showed 2,798 suspected gang members had been deported so far this fiscal year, which began in October. That figure includes all gangs, not just MS-13.\\n\\nTrump has adopted a more aggressive stance towards undocumented immigrants. Between late January and late April, his administration arrested an average of 108 undocumented immigrants a day with no criminal record, an increase of about 150% from the same period a year ago.\\n\\nBut Barrientos of Make the Road believes that such increasing immigration enforcement action makes undocumented immigrants more fearful of arrest and deportation, which only helps MS-13.\\n\\nUS Attorney Robert Capers, left, flanked by members of the FBI and Nassau and Suffolk County Police, speaks at a news conference in March. They announced the indictment of suspects in seven gang-related slayings.\\n\\n\"This situation is actually putting people who are very vulnerable in a more precarious situation because then they remain at the mercy of gangs,\" he said.\\n\\nPolice in Nassau County say immigrants and victims of MS-13, such as Margarita and her son, should still feel safe coming forward.\\n\\n\"I can say without any doubt ... we never, never ask any (immigration) status and we don\\'t care, on victims and witnesses,\" said Detective Sgt. Michael Morino of Nassau County Police\\'s gang investigation squad.\\n\\nBut the Nassau County District Attorney\\'s office said calls to their Immigrant Affairs Tips Hotline are way down in 2017.\\n\\n\"Because immigrants are scared to call law enforcement, crimes are going unreported, victims are not getting justice, criminals are going unpunished and we are all less safe,\" says Silvia Finkelstein, the office\\'s director of immigrant affairs.\\n\\nDavid and Alex don\\'t disagree.\\n\\n\"They [MS-13] feel like they can do whatever they want, \\'cause Trump himself has made everybody fear,\" Alex said. \"He\\'s helping them.\"', '', '(CNN)In the end, nothing was more damaging to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare than President Donald Trump himself. His performance in handling the first major legislative initiative of his administration was a complete failure of leadership. Had this been an episode of \"The Apprentice,\" someone would be sitting around the boardroom table telling the commander in chief, \"You\\'re fired!\"\\n\\nYes, it is difficult to dismantle any major piece of social policy. Once Americans become used to a program, no matter how controversial, taking away those benefits often fails. History is filled with examples, such as Social Security, where battles to retrench the social safety net go down in flames. But the Senate Republicans fell only one vote short of the number needed to keep the repeal effort alive.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is blaming the Democrats for the defeat that makes him look like much less than a master of the Senate.\\n\\nYet in this case the President must bear a huge part of the burden. This was an epic fail. With united government, a stunned Democratic Party and a promise to repeal that had been the rallying cry for the GOP since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Republicans faced pretty good odds that they could get some kind of bill to the President\\'s desk.\\n\\nBut that didn\\'t happen. Trump subverted their efforts at each step. The endless distractions and chaos from his Twitter account were devastating. There was no sustained effort from the White House to build legislative support for the bill or to sell the notion of an alternative health care system to the public.\\n\\nAt most he used his social media pulpit to castigate and cajole congressional Republicans who were in fact trying to work around the obstacles he created. Without any kind of message or vision, voters didn\\'t see any reason to rally around this plan -- and enough Republicans on the Hill heard the message loud and clear. His biggest speech during the final days of the legislative battles was a fiery campaign one to the Boy Scouts.\\n\\nThe sudden announcement about reversing the Obama administration\\'s policy allowing transgender people to serve in the military shocked and stunned Washington right when senators were trying to vote. At the key moment of decision-making, the new White House communications director was doing his job in very new ways by engaging in \"locker room talk\" with a New Yorker reporter about the President\\'s top advisers.\\n\\nThe truth is out. Nobody is in control of this show.\\n\\nThe entire process was really a stunning display of dysfunctional policymaking. Historically whenever presidents take up major domestic initiatives, they have their staff work out broad objectives or detailed plans that become the basis of congressional debate.\\n\\nThey don\\'t allow the entire process to deteriorate into what we saw -- legislators voting on invisible plans and then trying to make a big decision in a haphazard way, threatening to make massive changes to a key part of the economy without any sense of what they were doing. The President\\'s decision to allow the debate to go this way reflected his complete lack of engagement with public policy.\\n\\nThe road is littered with the bodies of politicians who have been insulted and humiliated by Trump, and they aren\\'t at all inclined to help him. Sen. John McCain, the Vietnam War hero whom Trump once mocked for having been taken captive, cast a pivotal vote against the \"skinny bill\" that would have given the GOP one more shot to work out a deal in conference committee. Though McCain disappointed many people when he voted earlier this week to allow the bill to be debated, in the end he had no interest in enabling this chaos to continue.\\n\\nOther senators such as Alaska\\'s Lisa Murkowski refused to be intimidated by Trump\\'s threats. And Trump didn\\'t earn much credit when he publicly threatened Sen. Dean Heller rather than courting him.\\n\\nReports suggest that Trump\\'s decision to lash out publicly at Attorney General Jeff Sessions not only angered Republicans on Capitol Hill but spread doubts they could trust him to stand by the party down the line after they took a tough and unpopular vote. Disloyalty matters in Washington.\\n\\nWhile Trump likes to dismiss all the norms and processes of Washington as a bad odor from the \"swamp\" that needs to be drained, in reality they are the product of decades of politics as presidents have learned through experience how to make things work in our complicated and disjointed political system. A president ignores all of this received wisdom at his own risk.\\n\\nWe live in an era when everyone mocks Washington insiders, but the ultimate outsider president could have benefited from some insider knowledge. Trump seemed to have almost no idea how the legislative process worked. When he called the House bill \"mean,\" Trump didn\\'t seem to understand the kind of political risks legislators have to take when they vote at each step of an uncertain process.\\n\\nAfter the Senate voted to let the bill reach the floor, Trump seemed to think that victory had been achieved. \"They say, if you look historically, this is the tough vote to get.\" His experts didn\\'t fill him in about how the rest of the process works. Early Friday, he learned along with the rest of us that the Republicans couldn\\'t get enough votes to pass a repeal bill.\\n\\nThe timing of the entire battle was thrown off by Trump\\'s antics and the energy the Russia investigation has consumed -- largely because of the President\\'s own statements and actions, along with misleading information from members of his team.\\n\\nDemocrats shouldn\\'t pop the champagne corks too soon. McConnell could try for another repeal vote. Trump could move forward with his plan to subvert the Affordable Care Act from within, by failing to enforce the individual mandate to buy health insurance, holding back subsidies or continuing to create doubts about the future of the program that cause major insurers to pull out. All of this would be extraordinarily damaging to Obamacare, preventing it from fulfilling its objectives.\\n\\nBack on the Hill, there remains the slim possibility that Senate Republicans will move in a different path now, working around Trump and accepting Sen. Chuck Schumer\\'s offer to find a bipartisan fix to health care.\\n\\nIt is not a surprise that more conservative voices are slowly, and hesitantly, starting to express their opposition to Trump. His failures as a leader are coming at a high cost. President Lyndon Johnson always reminded his advisers that time was the most valuable commodity in Washington since the party in power has so little of it. Legislators quickly focus on the next midterm campaign and are less willing to take risks for the president. The opposition party, moreover, becomes less hesitant about taking on the president as the \"momentum\" from the presidential election fades.\\n\\nAs the month of July comes to a close, it should be clear to Republicans they are losing their opportunity to enact major legislation even though they control Congress and the White House. They must be realizing that things are not going to get better in the Oval Office. There is no pivot coming; this is the new normal.\\n\\nIn January, many experts -- including me -- were predicting that President Barack Obama\\'s legacy was at serious risk. Some of the predictions have turned out to be true, such as on measures to curb climate change. But thus far with health care, Trump is turning out to be Obama\\'s savior.', 'Story highlights\\n\\nCharlie died one day after a judge\\'s order to stop life support and transfer him to hospice\\n\\nCharlie would have turned 1 on August 4\\n\\n(CNN)British baby Charlie Gard, who was at the center of a legal battle that captured the world\\'s attention, died Friday, one week before his first birthday.\\n\\n\"Our beautiful little boy has gone, we\\'re so proud of him,\" his mother, Connie Yates, said in a statement.\\n\\nCharlie was born on August 4, 2016, seemingly healthy. But two months into his short life his parents noticed his health was declining. They took him to London\\'s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in October where he remained at least until Thursday.\\n\\nHe was diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and loss of motor skills. Charlie was the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with the disease, according to his parents.\\n\\nAs the disease progressed, Charlie became weaker, losing the ability to move his arms or legs or breathe, and he experienced seizures. He was then placed on a ventilator that was breathing for him.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nThis photo of Charlie became a symbol of the ethical debates around the right to life and the right of doctors -- or relatives - to say when life should end.\\n\\nThrough their own research, Charlie\\'s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States doing research on an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy who was willing to treat Charlie.\\n\\nThe doctor, Michio Hirano of New York\\'s Columbia University Medical Center, specializes in myopathies and other neuromuscular diseases. He was not identified until July under court order.\\n\\nThe treatment used as part of Hirano\\'s research has only been used on a couple of patients with a less severe form of the disorder.\\n\\nAt the end of January, Charlie\\'s parents launched a GoFundMe page to raise money to bring Charlie to the United States for that treatment. In three months, they exceeded their £1.3 million ($1.65 million) goal to cover the costs, but the hospital stepped in and opposed this effort, stating that it was not in the best interest of their patient.\\n\\nIn February, the hospital decided, based on Charlie\\'s status, that treatment was unlikely to benefit Charlie. Unable to agree, the hospital went to court to have a judge decide, hoping to be able to remove Charlie from life support.\\n\\nChris Gard and Connie Yates with their son Charlie\\n\\nWhat could have been a private loss quickly turned into an international court drama.\\n\\nIn April, the UK High Court ruled that it was in the infant\\'s best interest for his treating clinicians to remove the ventilator keeping him alive. That decision was then backed by the European Court of Human Rights in June, which ruled not to intervene in the case. This was upheld by a British Supreme Court decision that the hospital could discontinue life support to Charlie and he could not be transferred to the US or elsewhere.\\n\\nThe emotional case then went to the UK High Court last week after the hospital requested another hearing to consider \"new evidence relating to potential treatment for his condition.\"\\n\\nThat new evidence, came in part from Hirano whotestified that there was an 11% to 56% chance Charlie could show clinically significant improvement if treated. Hirano came to London, evaluated Charlie and spoke with those who had been treating him and other experts.\\n\\nThe world was watching\\n\\nCharlie\\'s story and his parent\\'s fight caught the attention of world leaders near and far, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who supported the hospital, while Pope Francis tweeted his support for Charlie\\'s parents.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump weighed in, too, offering assistance to the family. Pro-life campaigners and right-wing politicians from both sides of the Atlantic seized the opportunity to chime in.\\n\\nThe case resurfaced a decades-old debate over euthanasia and the use of life support, issues that have been fought in most corners of the world and that have often seen medical and religious arguments collide.\\n\\nDoctors and staff at the Great Ormond Street Hospital were subjected to a \"shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance,\" in the street and online, the hospital said.\\n\\nThe end\\n\\nOn Monday, Charlie\\'s parents gave up their fight to take Charlie to the US after new brain and muscle scans revealed their son had deteriorated and was therefore less likely to benefit from the experimental treatment, while his doctors and parents battled in court. Too much time had passed.\\n\\nCharlie Gard reads a statement outside the court on Monday.\\n\\nBut the court battle was not over yet. The hospital and parents found themselves in court once again this week.This time, Charlie\\'s parents argued for the right to bring Charlie home from the hospital to die rather than the hospital or hospice.The hospital argued there were too many obstacles including the unwillingness of any care provider to accompany Charlie. The disagreement focused on whether Charlie\\'s ventilation tubes should be withdrawn in the hospital, in the hospice, at home soon after transfer or at home after a period of days.\\n\\nOn Thursday, with the hospital and Charlie\\'s parents still at an impasse, the judge\\'s order to remove life support and move Charlie to hospice took effect.\\n\\n\"We just want some peace with our son, no hospital, no lawyers, no courts, no media, just quality time with Charlie away from everything to say goodbye to him in the most loving way,\" Yates said in a statement after the judge\\'s order was given.\\n\\nJoin the conversation\\n\\nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n\"Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn\\'t save you.

They called Charlie their hero.', 'Story highlights\\n\\nNORAD determined the launch did not pose a threat to North America\\n\\nNorth Korea has accelerated its intercontinental range ballistic missile program\\n\\nWashington (CNN)The United States detected an intercontinental ballistic missile launch out of North Korea at approximately 10:45 am ET on Friday, the Pentagon confirmed to CNN -- Pyongyang\\'s second such test this month.\\n\\nThe missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and traveled about 1000 km before splashing down in the waters off the Japanese coast, according to the Pentagon, which is working with interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.\\n\\nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\\n\\n\"Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation,\" a statement from the Pentagon said.\\n\\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Japanese broadcaster NHK: \"I have received the first report that North Korea again launched a missile and it possibly landed inside the exclusive economic zone.\"\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nJapan\\'s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile launched by North Korea possibly flew for approximately 45 minutes.\\n\\nSuga told reporters there is no damage to any vessel or aircraft -- adding that the missile is believed to have fallen in Japan\\'s exclusive economic zone.\\n\\nSouth Korea\\'s joint chiefs of staff said they estimate that the intercontinental ballistic missile is more advanced than one launched last month based on the range it traveled.\\n\\n\"The altitude is about 3,700 km and the flying distance is about 1,000 km. It is estimated that it was a more advanced type of an ICBM compared to the previous one based on the range,\" a statement to CNN said.\\n\\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., and the commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, called the Republic of Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Lee Sun Jin in the wake of North Korea\\'s test to express the ironclad commitment to the US-Republic of Korea alliance and discuss military response options.\\n\\nThe ongoing assessment from the US intelligence community in recent months has been that North Korea has accelerated its intercontinental range ballistic missile program.\\n\\nThe US believes that North Korea will be able to launch a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by early 2018, a US official familiar with the latest intelligence assessment confirmed to CNN Wednesday.\\n\\nThat would be an acceleration of two years from previous estimates that put Pyongyang three to five years from fully developing long-range missile capabilities.\\n\\nThe official clarified to CNN that while North Korea can currently get a missile \"off the ground,\" there are still a lot of undetermined variables about guidance, re-entry and the ability to hit a specific target.\\n\\nCNN reported earlier this month that US intelligence indicated that North Korea was making preparations for another ICBM or intermediate range missile test.\\n\\nTwo administration officials familiar with the latest intelligence at the time confirmed they\\'d seen indicators of test preparations.\\n\\n\"In all honesty, we should not be surprised anymore: North Korea is slowly morphing into a nuclear and missile power right before our very eyes,\" said Harry J. Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korea.\\n\\n2017 has been a year of rapid progress for North Korea\\'s missile program.\\n\\nPyongyang has carried out 12 missile tests since February and conducted its first-ever test of an ICBM on July 4 -- which it claims could reach \"anywhere in the world.\"\\n\\n\"North Korea will continue to test over and over again its missile technology and nuclear weapons in the months and years to come in order to develop the most lethal systems it can,\" Kazianis said. \"You can bet every time they do tensions will continue to rise. This is what makes the situation on the Korean Peninsula as dangerous as it is.\"\\n\\nLess than six years into his reign, Kim Jong Un has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined.\\n\\nWhat are President Trump\\'s options?\\n\\nDoug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in foreign policy, told CNN that North Korea\\'s missile launch shows Pyongyang is \"absolutely committed to their missile programs\" and not interested in tempering their activities.\\n\\nBandow, who visited North Korea just last month, said the regime is convinced that developing its missile program as a nuclear deterrent is absolutely necessary -- a mindset that continues to put pressure on President Donald Trump, who finds himself in a situation with no good choices, according to Bandow.\\n\\nTrump has often cited China, North Korea\\'s longtime ally, as a key player in reining in North Korea\\'s quest to have long-range nuclear missiles.\\n\\nBut diplomatic efforts calling for China to put pressure on Pyongyang or enforce meaningful sanctions on North Korean revenue streams used to fund its missile program have proven ineffective to date.\\n\\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has put countries on notice that if they or their companies help North Korea -- also known as the DPRK -- they\\'ll face penalties. That mostly means China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea\\'s trade.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t seem to be working yet.\\n\\nLawmakers in the US House and Senate have overwhelmingly passed a bill that would impose additional economic sanctions on North Korea, but the White House has not definitively said Trump will sign the sweeping measure that also tightens restrictions on Iran and Russia.\\n\\nRepublican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, implored Trump to sign the bill following North Korea\\'s missile test on Friday.\\n\\n\"These missile tests must be met with consequences. Earlier this week, I voted to increase sanctions against North Korea. The Senate has since taken the same action. I urge the President to quickly sign these sanctions into law to thwart further escalation of North Korea\\'s missile systems,\" a statement from Turner said.\\n\\nEven if Trump does sign the bill there is no guarantee that additional sanctions will slow North Korea\\'s march toward a long-range nuclear missile.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Beijing called on Pyongyang to suspend its nuclear and missile tests while calling on the US to stop military exercises on and near the Korean Peninsula, which North Korea sees as a threat to its sovereignty.\\n\\nBut neither the US nor North Korea has shown any willingness to compromise as the situation has escalated in recent months.\\n\\nLast month, CNN reported that the US military updated its options for North Korea with the goal of giving Trump plans for a rapid response, according to two US military officials at the time.\\n\\nOfficials said the options, which include a military response, would be presented to the President if Pyongyang conducted an underground nuclear or ballistic missile test that indicates the regime has made significant progress toward developing a weapon that could attack the US.\\n\\nBut a US preemptive attack continues to be highly problematic option because the Pentagon has long believed North Korea would in turn attack South Korea.\\n\\nCIA Director Mike Pompeo said last week that the Trump administration needed to find a way to separate Kim from his growing nuclear stockpile.\\n\\n\"As for the regime, I am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system,\" Pompeo said. \"The North Korean people I\\'m sure are lovely people and would love to see him go.\"\\n\\nThose comments were met with harsh rhetoric from North Korea, which threatened a nuclear strike on \"the heart of the US\" if it attempts to remove Kim Jong Un as Supreme Leader, Pyongyang\\'s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Tuesday.\\n\\nKCNA reported that a spokesman from the North Korean foreign ministry said, \"The DPRK legally stipulates that if the supreme dignity of the DPRK is threatened, it must preemptively annihilate those countries and entities that are directly or indirectly involved in it, by mobilizing all kinds of strike means including the nuclear ones.\"\\n\\n\"Should the US dare to show even the slightest sign of attempt to remove our supreme leadership, we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the US with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time,\" the foreign ministry spokesman added.', 'Thousands evacuate NC island after power outage\\n\\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.

We just wish it didn\\'t end so abruptly,\" she said. \"We definitely didn\\'t have time to do everything we wanted.\"\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nAccording to state and utility officials, a transmission line was cut during construction work and it knocked out electricity in the tourist mecca known as the Outer Banks, including Hatteras Island in Dare County and Ocracoke Island in Hyde County.\\n\\nIt\\'s not known how long it will take for power to be restored.\\n\\nThe outage spurred authorities to issue an evacuation order for Ocracoke visitors. No such orders were made for tourists on Hatteras Island, but people trickled out, made plans to do so or went with the flow and adjusted.\\n\\nPeople noticed the outage on Thursday morning.\\n\\nSandi Beck, 52, of Trinity, North Carolina, said she and her husband were in Avon when power went out. She and her husband got ice, put perishables in coolers and bought a camping grill.\\n\\n\"We feel as though we\\'re basically camping in a house,\" she said on Friday.\\n\\nThe sea breeze didn\\'t permeate their rental house, so it was tough sleeping. She and her family were planning to leave in the evening.\\n\\n\"It will be nice to sleep in air conditioning tonight,\" she said.\\n\\nThe situation has inconvenienced travelers and a region dependent on tourist dollars. At the peak of the vacation season, Gov. Roy Cooper signed a state of emergency on Thursday.\\n\\n\"This declaration will allow us to move much needed resources through the state as quickly as possible to help restore the power to Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands,\" Cooper said.\\n\\nThe declaration allows officials to get the resources in place to deal with the emergency.

Since late Thursday, they\\'ve been ferried out.\\n\\nTideland Electric Membership Corporation was bringing in and installing three mobile generators to supply essential power for those who live and work year round. All three generators were expected to be on the island Friday.\\n\\nThe outages rolled through Hatteras and Ocracoke after PCL Construction, the company constructing the new Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, told the Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative (CHEC) that it \"drove a steel casing into the underground transmission cable that runs between the south end of the Bonner Bridge and the overhead riser pole.\"\\n\\nAnd that caused the outage.\\n\\nCHEC provides power to the seven Hatteras Island villages and its transmission cable goes underneath Hatteras Inlet and into Okracoke.\\n\\nThe utility said it was providing temporary power to Hatteras Island using a diesel generating plant in Buxton and Frisco and is installing nine generators.\\n\\n\"We are hopeful that once these nine generators are installed, we can provide more continuous temporary power,\" said Laura Ertle, CHEC spokeswoman. \"We\\'re going to hook them up through the island.\"\\n\\nIt was the 21st year that Erica Carlson\\'s family vacationed on the Outer Banks, but the first time there was an extended power outage.\\n\\nCarlson 48, of Oakland, Maryland, was part of a group of 15 in an oceanfront rental in the community of Waves. They planned to have a family poker tournament. And the outage didn\\'t stop them. They bought candles and ice and a battery lantern and put them to good use.\\n\\n\"We play lots of card games on vacation but the Texas Hold \\'em tourney is a tradition.

The sanctions also included the closure of two Russian compounds, in Maryland and New York, used for intelligence purposes.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nJohn Tefft, US ambassador to Russia, expressed \"strong disappointment and protest\" over Moscow\\'s decision to expel the US diplomats, according to a statement from the US Embassy in Moscow.\\n\\nTrump still to sign or veto bill\\n\\nMoscow\\'s latest move comes a day after the US Senate passed sweeping legislation slapping new sanctions on Russia -- over its alleged interference in last year\\'s election, annexation of Crimea and military operations in eastern Ukraine -- and limiting President Donald Trump\\'s ability to remove them.\\n\\nThe bill, which also includes new sanctions on Iran and North Korea, was a product of lengthy negotiations between the House and Senate. In the end, both chambers passed it overwhelmingly.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters late Thursday that the President would review the sanctions bill. She did not say whether Trump would sign or veto the measure when it reaches his desk. The wide, bipartisan support for the law means Congress could override a presidential veto.\\n\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on a conference call Friday that Moscow had decided to retaliate before the bill went to Trump because \"technically the form passed by the Senate is more important\" and is \"almost final.\"\\n\\nAsked if Russian President Vladimir Putin had authorized the move, Peskov said such measures are \"impossible without the President\\'s permission.\"\\n\\nHe added that possible amendments to the bill would not change the \"essence\" of the matter.\\n\\nImmediately after the United States ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recommended a tit-for-tat expulsion of 35 US diplomats and the shuttering of two American facilities in Russia. However, Putin at that point took a magnanimous tone, saying they could stay and that he would await Trump\\'s inauguration before taking further action.\\n\\nCommentators said then that Putin\\'s unexpected move put Trump at a disadvantage, even as it sidelined the Obama administration in its last days.\\n\\nPutin sees \\'anti-Russia hysteria\\'\\n\\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said the new sanctions law \"confirms the extreme aggressiveness of the United States in its foreign affairs.\"\\n\\nIt accused the United States of using the law to \"create unfair competitive advantages for the US in the global economy\" and said its actions breached international law. \"Such blackmail, aimed at limiting the interaction of foreign partners with Russia, carries a threat to many countries and international businesses.\"\\n\\nSpeaking Thursday in Finland,Putin said he \"very much regrets\" the worsening of relations between Russia and the United States, blaming it on \"anti-Russia hysteria\" in US domestic politics.\\n\\nHe said a lot of Russian diplomats had been expelled \"without any particular reason\" and warned that Russia would have to respond at some point to what he called \"boorish behavior.\"\\n\\nLavrov spoke Friday to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by phone, according the Russian Foreign Ministry. The two agreed to maintain contact \"on the full scope of the Russian-American relations,\" it said.\\n\\nLavrov said the decision to cut US diplomatic staff in Russia and to close access to two facilities was a result of a series of \"hostile steps\" by Washington, according to the ministry statement.\\n\\nBut Russia, Lavrov said, is ready to normalize bilateral relations and cooperate on important issues on the international agenda.\\n\\nThe new sanctions bill would add to a raft of coordinated sanctions the United States and European Union imposed in 2014 over Russia\\'s annexation of Crimea and its interference in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The measures were largely aimed at hurting the Russian economy but also hit certain Russian individuals with travel bans and asset freezes.\\n\\nHowever, EU leaders warned the United States on Wednesday that the bloc would act \"within days\" if it did not receive reassurances on the potential impact of the new US sanctions on European interests. They fear the new sanctionscould hinder key energy projects in Europe and further inflame internal EU divisions.\\n\\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Friday it was now up to Trump to decide how to proceed.\\n\\n\"We will continue to want to work together. We must not forget what is at stake: We want to overcome the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We agree that it needs political pressure on Moscow. This is the rationale and the standard for our European sanctions, no more, but not less,\" he said.\\n\\nBut Gabriel added that Germany \"will in no way accept an extraterritorial application of these US sanctions against European companies. ... Policy sanctions are neither a suitable nor an adequate instrument for the promotion of national export interests and the domestic energy sector.\"\\n\\nCNN\\'s Yon Pomrenze reported from Moscow and Alla Eshchenko from Atlanta, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.
